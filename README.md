# TayTech
We wished to create an End-To-End Text-to-Speech model that is capable of sythesizing Morgan Freeman's voice from text. We replicated the Tacotron model designed by Google. We were able to replicate the model, however the lack of Morgan Freeman audio prevented us from generating his voice. Thus we switched to the LJ Speech Dataset.  

## Installation Instructions. 
1. Download the code. Download the [LJ Speech Dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/).
2. Modify these variables in config.py. 
   - `LOG_DIR`: location of model checkpoints
   - `MODEL_NAME`: the name of the model file to load
   - `DATA_PATH`: location of the dataset
   - `TEST_DATA`: text file used to synthesize audio if not passing in text to predict in the code
   - `SAVE_DIR`: where to save sythesized outputs
   - `DEVICE`: cpu or gpu depending on your computer

## Instruction to Run
1. Training - run `train.py` to train
2. Evaluation - run `eval.py` to evaluate
3. Synthesize - run `synthesizer.py` to synthesize output that is stored in `SAVE_DIR`. Either pass in text in the code or modify `TEST_DATA`

## Results
Although the code runs, we did not have suitable hardware to sufficiently train the model. Thus we were unable to synthesize new output. Output samples generated by the model in early stages of training are stored in the `Results` directory.

## Dependencies
Runs on Python 3
- Conda >= 4.4.10
- tensorflow >= 1.6
- librosa >= 0.6.0
- numpy >= 1.14.1
- matplotlib >= 2.2.2
- scipy >= 1.0.0
- tqdm

## Data
Two datasets were used. 
  - [LJ Speech Dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/)
  - [Morgan Freeman Audio](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1efzGhWzDOpSxnCnofrmSYX_j7cYokCzN)
  The model was trained on the [LJ Speech Dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/). Although the Morgan Freeman Data was gathered, it was insufficient for training the model.
